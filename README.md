Hello guys, I am Manvender Meena (Roll No: 21124027) from the Mathematics and Computing branch at IIT BHU.
This is my small project named Code Vault.

Code Vault:
Code Vault is a simple version control system made using C++.
It can store file changes, make commits, and manage different branches — just like a basic Git.
I built it to understand how version control works internally.
It works end to end, and I am currently working on adding new functionalities.
